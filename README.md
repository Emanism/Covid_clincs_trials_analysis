COVID Clinical Trials Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a COVID clinical trials dataset, demonstrating the power of Python, particularly Pandas and NumPy, to explore and extract meaningful insights from real-world data.

**Overview**
This project thoroughly explores and analyzes a COVID clinical trials dataset. The analysis was conducted in several stages, each aiming to uncover different aspects of the data:

Initial Exploration:

Examined the dataset's structure by checking its shape and viewing the columns.
Visualized the first and last 'n' rows (where n = 5, 15, 30) using the head() and tail() functions to get an initial sense of the data.

Data Understanding:

Explored column data types using the info() function.
Applied the describe() function to gain statistical insights into the dataset, thereby documenting key observations.

Missing Values Analysis:

Determined the missing values across the entire dataset to identify any gaps in data.
Analyzed missing values in each column to understand the data's completeness.

Duplicate Rows Analysis:

Calculated the sum of duplicate rows in the dataset to ensure data integrity and uniqueness.

Group By Analysis:

Formulated and answered five questions using the group-by method to understand trends and distributions across different categories.

Conditional Statement Analysis:

Developed and solved five questions using conditional statements, enabling the filtering and identifying specific data subsets based on set criteria.


Analysis Performed

Group By Analysis:

Determined the number of clinical trials for each medical condition.
Calculated the count of trials for each trial status.
Identified the number of unique sponsors or collaborators for each condition.
Counted the clinical trials conducted in each country.
Found the earliest start date for clinical trials by condition.

Conditional Statement Analysis:

Counted the number of trials with 'No Results Available.'
Identified the number of trials in an 'Active, not recruiting' status.
Determined the number of trials related to 'COVID-19'.
Counted the number of trials that started after January 1, 2020.
Identified trials involving 'Diagnostic Test' interventions.
Tools and Libraries Used
Python: The core programming language used for the analysis.
Pandas: Employed for data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Utilized for numerical operations where needed.

Conclusion

This analysis not only provides valuable insights into the landscape of COVID clinical trials but also serves as an exemplar of leveraging Python's data analysis capabilities to make informed decisions. It's a testament to the power of data analysis in understanding complex datasets and extracting useful information in a structured, understandable manner.
